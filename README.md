GAZETTEER PROJECT -

This web app shows a world map where the user can select a country to display information about it. When a country is selected the app zooms into it, showing a variety of up to date information. This app has been designed with dynamism in mind focusing on the user experience. To achieve that the user has a selection of buttons available and markers spread around the map at key locations.
